2nd Major Analysis Project ft. Tableau


This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Tableau to analyze employee attrition patterns and workforce demographics. The dataset contains detailed employee-level data including department, job role, age, gender, satisfaction scores, and salary distribution.

Key highlights of the dashboard:
* 📊 Executive KPIs: Displays overall employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, and average age in a single glance.

* 🧩 Department & Education-Wise Attrition: Visualizes which departments and education fields experience higher attrition rates.

* 🧠 Age Distribution: A histogram shows the number of employees across age groups with a dynamic age-bin slicer for flexibility.

* 🌟 Job Satisfaction Analysis: Heatmap captures employee satisfaction across different job roles.

* ⚖️ Gender-wise Salary Distribution: Compares average income by job roles across male and female employees with visual benchmarks.

This dashboard is designed for HR teams and analysts to:
  Identify patterns in attrition
  Correlate satisfaction scores with turnover
  Evaluate salary parity across genders
  Make data-driven decisions for workforce planning
